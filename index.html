       <h3>About :</h3>
        <p class="About">I’m a customer service professional currently working with Eulen Group at Tampa International Airport (American Sales & Management), where I support travelers and deliver a smooth, high-quality customer experience. 
            I recently started this role in January and bring a background that blends operations leadership, design, and technology.
            Previously, I worked for over a year as a Kitchen & Bath Designer at Marvis Enterprises Corporation, where I partnered with clients to turn ideas into functional designs and managed projects from concept to completion. 
            I also served as Patio Operations Manager at Vilo Fence, leading day-to-day operations, coordinating teams, and keeping work moving safely and efficiently.
            Academically, I earned an A.A. in Computer Science from Hillsborough Community College (HCC) and I’m currently pursuing a B.S. in Business Analytics & Information Systems at the University of South Florida (USF) with  Cybersecurity concentration. 
            I’m especially interested in roles that combine data, operations, and customer experience, where I can improve performance through smarter processes and analytics.</p>
